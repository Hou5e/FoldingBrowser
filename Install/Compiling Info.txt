Compiling the FoldingBrowser Installer Info
============================================


One-time Setup Info:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm currently using NSIS v3.02.1, but the latest version will work fine from: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
** Make sure to get the normal 32-bit NSIS download (right-hand side of the web page), and not the 3rd party NSIS projects from the bottom of the web page. **

There are a couple plugin files you will need to manually add:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsProcess_plugin   (Get the version with Unicode)

Copy include file (nsProcess.nsh) to:   C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Include

Copy plugin file (nsProcess.dll) to:  C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Plugins\x86-ansi
Copy plugin file (nsProcessW.dll) to:  C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Plugins\x86-unicode
Rename that file to: nsProcess.dll   (Remove the  'W')

I use the front-end 'HM NIS Edit', from:   http://hmne.sourceforge.net/

I typically associate *.nsi files with the 'HM NIS Edit' executable so they can be opened and accessed easily.
    -If you go to the ..\Install folder, and right-click one of the .nsi files
    -Select 'Open With...'
    -Then 'Choose default program'
    -And browse to the 'HM NIS Edit' executable file at: C:\Program Files (x86)\HMSoft\NIS Edit\nisedit.exe
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For compiling the FoldingBrowser Installer:
-------------------------------------------
The NSIS installer scripts are located at:   ..\Install

1. You will need the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015 - 32-bit (x86) installer (vc_redist.x86.exe) from: https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/3/F/93FCF1E7-E6A4-478B-96E7-D4B285925B00/vc_redist.x86.exe      Link from: https://www.itechtics.com/microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-versions-direct-download-links/
and copy it to:  ..\Install\VCx86Redist

2. You will need the latest CureCoin wallet (curecoin-qt.exe) from GitHub: https://github.com/cygnusxi/CurecoinSource/releases
and copy it to:  ..\Install\CureCoin

3. Compile the CureCoin installer script first. The output goes to: ..\Install\CureInst
(this was done mostly for an easy separate uninstaller for the CureCoin Wallet)

4. Compile the FoldingBrowser script last. This uses the 'Release' version of the FoldingBrowser executable compiled with Visual Studio.

Visual Studio Compiling Notes:
------------------------------
-Any time the CefSharp DLLs are upgraded to the next version (Use NuGet Package Manager, command: update-package):
   -Any previous versions of those DLLs need to be manually deleted from the Debug & Release folders before Visually Studio will compile the new executable without errors.
   -The project reference folder path to the previous DLLs will need to be manually updated in the project settings to the new package folder
