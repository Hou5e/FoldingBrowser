====================================
FoldingBrowser All-in-One Installer:
====================================

-----------------------------------
Immediate Need /  Short-Term Goals:
-----------------------------------

-Try new VS and update browser component?
-Evaluate upgrading to CefSharp/Chrome v111, when available: https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/releases
-Update FoldingBrowserTitle.gif so it doesn't look blank when not auto-playing in GitHub
-On installation, see if FAH is running and show the web control if it is, instead of a blank page (mostly for upgrade installs)
-Update video on website. It's pretty stale now
-Possibly add options for Gridcoin + CureCoin sign up
-Detect FAH v8 and use different FAH web control URL: https://app.foldingathome.org/  instead of FAH v7: http://127.0.0.1:7396/?nocache=0.###
-Start planning about FAH v8, or making a striped down version that is faster, less overhead, and compatible?
-Can't wipe-out saved data to be blank (can do it from the raw data view)
-Make saved data changes prompt you to: 'Save changes?' when changing wallet numbers, or auto-save?
-Start with Wallet #1 instead of #0, as the default wallet used for initial setup?
-Make a simple setup: Do you want FLDC? Do you want Cure? Pick username (hide stuff that doesn't apply) (Add CureCoin folding pool rules: more than 3? chars, no special chars). Have a checkbox for advanced (normally, hide the advanced setup)
-Add CTRL+A to: Options Raw data view, to select all
-Test and update any URL buttons to be current
-Make an option to turn on or off the Font scaling for the whole app. Try measuring the length of the text exceeding the size of the forms, or being smaller than other controls on the screen.

----------------------------------------------------
Other Ideas, Improvements, Tasks, Longer-Term Goals:
----------------------------------------------------
-Use built-in multi-language uninstaller strings for the one non-built-in uninstaller dialog on upgrading? (Ignoring for now)
-Enable Google Translate in Chrome/CefSharp for automatic web page translations?
-Add Multi-language support in the FoldingBrowser for button text (and tooltips)?
-Enable Multi-language support in the browser component to view pages that are available in other languages (Allow users to change the 'Locale' & 'AcceptLanguageList')? -Add language chosen from installer to 'AcceptLanguageList'? -Changing the language might make the search strings not work correctly anymore?
-Add images to improve dialog prompt errors, instructions, or questions (It will help non-English speaking users)
-Add an Ad Blocker Plugin, if possible?
-Improve the process to change the default encryption password on the FoldingBrowser Saved settings: INI file: when encryption password is blank, prompt for password, if encryption fails (for extra security for not keeping the PW in a text file in your user account). Option to be prompted for it: once per session, or prompted every time when needed.
-Make the other web page wait loops use JavaScript for detecting pages are fully loaded (like the CureCoin web page login), to make detection even less open loop
-Linux and Mac version of the AIO setup:
  -Try running the FoldingBrowser on Mono in Linux
  -Create an install script. Possibly use Docker to keep the installation simplified
  -Start over from a Chromium web browser project that can already be compiled for Linux and Mac? See Chromely(currently missing Mac compile): https://github.com/mattkol/Chromely
  -Port to and start from an existing MonoDevelop project that can already be compiled for Linux and Mac?
  -Create a separate Electron.NET App for Mac and Linux? -Try the FLDC Bar Electron app as a possible starting point?
  -Can the FoldingBrowser run on Wine in Linux? And, then update the FoldingBrowser to use the appropriate files and paths for Linux?
  -Convert to .NET 6 for Linux and Mac?
  -Create a simple encrypted dat file viewer for Linux and Mac (and include those files with making a backup, for going from Windows to Linux)?
-Improve the portal web page (eliminate some buttons in the browser UI, and replace with web page buttons? probably not since they would be more difficult to get back to without having a menu frame)
-Add FLDC & CURE Ticker info (from Coin Market Cap API?) (or pull from exchanges?). Update hourly? Do as notify icon? Might not be worth it, if the FLDC homepage gets it. See:  https://coinmarketcap.com/api/    https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/CureCoin/
-Add option to get Wallet info from blockchain explorer APIs to display value? FLDC- https://xchain.io/     CURE-  https://chainz.cryptoid.info/cure
-Save some stats from API data, and show difference from last time, or from a past time interval?
-Add notify icon (system tray icon) for folding and other coin ticker info?
-Option to create backup copies of the settings in a 'Backup' folder periodically, or get a pop-up reminder on a time interval?
-Make a better way to determine if the settings (.dat) file loads. This won't work: DAT.ToString.Length = 0, it really needs to be .SaveToString(), but all you want to know is there data loaded or not. You don't need a full text string output...
-Restore from backup button (or separate app)? Make something to make setting up multiple computers easier (rename existing files, and copy new one) (and telnet FAH settings from Config file)
-Add stop button to cancel the automated process?
-Get CounterWallet with CounterParty API instead of current methods from web page clicks? (probably more work than it's worth)
-Support other blockchain explorers?  like: (Using:)https://xchain.io/     (depreciated) https://counterpartychain.io/      https://chain.so/      https://walletapp.indiesquare.me/explorer/      https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/<addy>      https://xcpdex.com/
-Option to select alternate distribution stats server from: http://foldingcoin.xyz/?token=FLDC&total=250000&start=2017-08-21&end=2017-08-22 to using: http://fldc-stats.tokenly.com/?token=FLDC&total=250000&start=2017-08-21&end=2017-08-22
-Improve the CureCoin HTTP JSON-RPC to use a JSON parser. And, find the wallet if there is more than one entry or (blank and a name)
-Show image of where to get the CureCoin wallet address, for the message box when it can't be found
-Try to fix/automate this known issue: -Discord invites go to a blank page (Press the 'Discord' button again to reload/fix)
-Improve the get .NET v4.0 from Microsoft message in the installer to: use Windows Update, or manually install from Microsoft's website?
-Integration with HFM.NET, or something similar
-Add other related website link buttons?    http://www.scienceblockchains.com/  (Maybe. Want to avoid too many buttons)    https://mergedfolding.net/  (Skip)      https://mergedfolding.net/official-distributions  (Skip)
-Add links to CoinMarketCap / CoinGecko (Maybe. It shouldn't be needed with website profit calculator)?     https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/foldingcoin/     https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curecoin/     https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/curecoin     https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/foldingcoin
-Add links to donation websites for both FLDC and CURE?  (maybe) -Donate Links: https://www.gofundme.com/help-cure-cancer-with-technology
-Add Web link buttons for Reddit URLs?
-Re-add the FLDC Shop button when link is restored. The store link was only good for 1 year: https://tokenmarkets.com/catalog/foldingcoin
-Add Web link button for a CureCoin Shop button for the CoinPayments URL? https://www.coinpayments.net/store-directory-coin-CURE (no longer listed with new service: https://cryptwerk.com/adv/add-coin/)-Add a CureCoin Wallet button, that focus a running CURE wallet executable, or launches it as a new process?
-Discord login for non-US keyboards: Maybe just pop-up a window with the login info to copy and paste from; hovered over the main window, but in the main form? Use copy and paste buffer, and then paste the info?
-Add support for zooming in on webpages?
-Right-click context menu: Add 'Find' to the list. Also, when highlighting text, add that text to the find dialog?
-Save more than one log file for debugging issues later?
-When hovering URLs, display the link at the bottom of the screen while hovering the link, or just for a few seconds, like other web browsers?
-Support SegWit addresses for FLDC (start with 'bc1' and are about 9 characters longer). Probably should get both addresses (Legacy and SegWit) from CounterWallet, and offer a pull-down list selection. Might need to get the 50 character CureCoin folding pool username limit raised.
-Installer: Change to a language selection page, instead of the pre-installer dialog box?
-Have a button to try and get a new CounterParty Bitcoin Address, if it's blank (with a timeout & retry for the mirror Counterwallet site). Or, message to run button #2 to get an address?
-Support other wallets, for pressing the 'FLDC Wallet' button, with option for:  https://freewallet.io/   Possibly include FreeWallet installer.    Other alternatives (ignore for now): https://wallet.indiesquare.me/     also: rarepepewallet.com (Not updated enough? security risks?)     (Not yet) https://tokenpockets.com/ (You cannot use tokenpockets currently. It is not compatible with existing passphrases from CounterWallet. If you want to use it, you will have to make a new address first)
-Informational: List keystrokes implemented on Settings/options page
-Add saving BTC private key with 12w password for new FLDC blockchain?

[DONE] -Update the BTC blockchain explorer URL format to be: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/<addy>
[DONE] -Make it so when the main CounterWallet site is down, (1 minute timeout) it tries the other mirror site. The website status says it's up, but it's not working (logging-in to your wallet doesn't do anything), so the alternative site was not being used (because the site status said it wasn't down).

[DONE] -CureCoin installer: Change the -rescan shortcut to -zapwallettxes (to fix orphans, that do happen periodically)
[DONE] -CefSharp v73: button panel fly-down is about 2x slower. Decreased redraw steps by half to compensate.
[DONE] -Fixing issue loading the FAH web control page, where the 'refresh without cache' was not being sent when needed, to fix the infinite refresh loop issue. By default, send 'refresh without cache' immediately, since it's needed most of the time.
[DONE] -Improving FAH username error messages for Segwit Bech32 'bc1' addresses
[DONE] -Evaluate upgrading to CefSharp/Chrome v73 (VC++2015) when released
[DONE] -Update to the latest bug fix version CefSharp/Chrome v71.0.2
[DONE] -Evaluate upgrading to CefSharp/Chrome v71 (VC++2015) when released
[DONE] -On exiting, sometime with a slow laptop the FoldingBrowser v20 hangs and doesn't cleanly exit. Once the webpages are cached better, then this doesn't reproduce. Probably just needs the exit time interval increased like when this was an issue in the past. Newer Chrome component should not have this problem now.
v20 Release (2019-01-20)
[DONE] -Improvement to auto-scale for different monitors with different scaling, Per-Monitor-DPI-Aware (like a laptop with large monitor)
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v2.0.0.2
[DONE] -Fixed Windows 10 scaling issue that causes the URL text box to not grow in height like everything else
[DONE] -Fixed Windows 10 scaling issue that causes the right-anchored form components to not size correctly
[DONE] -Fixed the Go button that was being hidden
[DONE] -Fixed Windows 10 scaling issue that causes the pull-down menu to be smaller, due to only being measured in a non-scaled pixel value (not sized on layout dimensions or DPI %).
[DONE] -Fixed loading button images for different scaling %. Resizing lager images down to the desired size looks like the best option. (Leave AutoScaleMode = Font for forms). 4x larger PNG images are now being used
[DONE] -CureCoin installer: Merge changes from two similar but slightly different installer scripts and use a command line option to differentiate
[DONE] -Update Copyright date for 2019
[DONE] -Installer: Make the Uninstall first dialog more robust to delete the uninstall registry keys if the uninstaller program file is gone, to allow the installation process to continue
[DONE] -CureCoin installer: Fix filenames to use dashes instead of underscores
[DONE] -Remove dat file entry "CureCoinWalletVersion" to avoid any confusion. It only displays the information of what version you signed up with, and doesn't get updated when you upgrade to a newer version (might be misleading after upgrading). Examples: CureCoinWalletVersion=v1.9.4.1-CUR    CureCoinWalletVersion=v2.0.0.1-CURE    -Delete this entry from the Dat file v19 or older on startup upgrade?
v19 Release (2018-12-24)
[DONE] -Improve Toggle the Tools section
[DONE] -Update CureCoin POS info: 4 day maturity (for v2.0) for staking, instead of 30 day (for v1.9.x.x)
[DONE] -Create CureCoin Wallet v2.0.0.1 installer with the CureCoin Blockchain for easier install for new and upgrading users. (For now, additionally keep the other style installer without the blockchain for any 'FoldingCoin only' people)
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v2.0.0.1
[DONE] -Improve the FAH Web Control page button behavior, where timing issues might cause it to load an extra time.
[DONE] -Upgrade to CefSharp/Chrome v69 (VC++2015)
[DONE] -CureCoin Wallet: Include a 'peers.dat' file for more bootstrap nodes with the CureCoin installer
v18 Release (2018-11-11)
[DONE] -Fixing getting a Passkey at the newer URL
[DONE] -Make an option: Make the button links panel only fly-down when you click on it (It's a bit annoying when you mouse-over it, and you don't want it shown). I like the mouse-enter behavior by default so people know the panel is there, otherwise it's not obvious enough.
[DONE] -Gear press, panel not shown, then just show panel (don't hide tools).
[DONE] -Update / fix Discord buttons for auto-login issue
[DONE] -Look into issue with the FAH Web Control not loading initially in CefSharp v67, until something gets created that allows it to load the FAH Web UI. On timeout, try going to: http://127.0.0.1:7396/?nocache=' + Math.random() [double between 0-1, formatted to 16 places. Using VB's random NextDouble gives 15 places by default]. Also, these pages won't be available if FAH is not running.
[DONE] -Update for new code signing certificate
[DONE] -Split the 2-page homepage the other direction (top/bottom, instead of the original left/right sides that aren't wide enough for the webpages to work well normally)

[DONE] -Fix tabbing order of form items to be correct
[DONE] -Check tool-tips on main window buttons
[DONE] -Add Folding@Home Twitter and News buttons (good for seeing updates, but probably not super useful info)
[DONE] -Add Stats website link buttons for both Team: https://stats.mergedfolding.net/    and User: https://stats.mergedfolding.net/member/<addy>    -Add similar CureCoin Team button to EOC: https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_summary.php?s=&t=224497
[DONE] -Add search 'topic' links to GitHub
[DONE] -Make web-link buttons more interesting and modern-looking, and not like old clunky buttons. Use Discord image[DONE], Twitter image[DONE] -Improve the layout, so they are not as dense[DONE] -Make the Tools and Bookmark panels symmetrical and not contending for the same screen space[DONE]
[DONE] -Add Fwd/Back navigation with 4th/5th mouse button clicks to the web control window [This seemed to work in CefSharp v67 without any extra code, and didn't in previous versions]
[DONE] -Make the 'Tools' checkbox an image for settings (gear, dots[like Chrome: not obvious enough], or lines icon[like FireFox: maybe]) for checked/unchecked
[DONE] -Upgrade to CefSharp/Chrome v67 (VC++2015)
[DONE] -Change to the new FLDC username format now that it's available

[DONE] -Upgrade to CefSharp/Chrome v65 (VC++2015), and updated the VC++ dependency in the installer

[DONE] -Add workaround for: FAH Web Control, where it gets stuck in an infinite refresh loop in Chrome v59+, and needs a refresh without cache to fix that condition.
[DONE] -Upgrade to CefSharp/Chrome v63 (VC++2013)
v16 Release (2018-02-12)
[DONE] -Add file exist searches to help determine if FAH is already installed on first-time use for setting the check box in the 3 check box dialog.
[DONE] -Add Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 - 32-bit (x86) installer to the FoldingBrowser installer (Not preloaded on new Win10 computers)
[DONE] -Change the button text: 'My Wallet' to 'FLDC Wallet', for clarity
[DONE] -The INI file and DAT file FAHUsername can get out of sync when modifying the raw data text for that duplicate item. Removed duplicate version of FAHUsername from the INI, and only use the DAT file version going forward.
[DONE] -Saved Data window: Changes to the raw data view were not updating the individual text box view of the data
[DONE] -Minor tweaks to try and avoid timing issues that might interfere with loading or saving the Dat file
[DONE] -Update Copyright date for 2018
[DONE] -CTRL+F: Find text in a page functionality (For searching for BTC address on distribution page, etc). Press CTRL+F: Open Find (Find Next: ENTER or F3, Find Previous: SHIFT+ENTER or SHIFT+F3, Close Find: ESC)
[DONE] -Forward and back navigation keystrokes or mouse clicks: Forward (ALT+Right, or Next{mouse button}), Back (ALT+Left, or Prior{mouse button}), and Web Tools (F12). 4th and 5th mouse button clicks as Xbutton1 & Xbutton2 only work when hovering the upper part of the form (The browser control doesn't support it in this version).
[DONE] -CTRL+F5: Refresh ignoring browser cache. F5: Refresh. (Previously, F5 did what only CTRL+F5 should do)

[DONE] -Add intro clips to tutorial videos to improve them
[DONE] -Split the installation video into initial install and features to keep it shorter.
[DONE] -Adding attempts to pressing the EOC button to get the UserId from searching for their FAH Username (the 3 attempts is for new users who's username won't be searchable for the first ~24 hours: Hopefully this will let them retry some other day)
[DONE] -Setup code signing certificate to sign installer & FoldingBrowser executable. Dual signed- SHA1 (for WinXP) and SHA-256 (for Win7-Win10)
[DONE] -Replace Slack with Discord for both CureCoin and FoldingCoin button links
[Known Issue] -Discord invites go to a blank page (Press the 'Discord' button again to reload/fix), and fail to load with error: WebSocket connection to 'ws://127.0.0.1:6465/?v=1' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (https://discordapp.com/assets/7bb110c91ee0ded4782a.js, ln 17 )
[DONE] -Option to change the initial portal homepage. Choices: Default (Both FoldingCoin and CureCoin), FoldingCoin, CureCoin, EOC, Folding@Home Web Control, Blank
[DONE] -Fix to disable the OK button until the FAH settings are saved. Pausing FAH with Telnet was not awaited, and was undoing this on an initial install only

[DONE] -Add instructions for compiling the NSIS installation kit
[DONE] -Trim the input Email text for getting a passkey
v14 Release (2017-10-31)

[DONE] -Make the portal homepage internal within the app
[DONE] -In the FAH Username selection, allow the CureCoin username format for earning CureCoin only (no FLDC username rules, just warnings). This is now allowed but not obvious on purpose.
[DONE] -Improve the CureCoin pool sign up process, search for: account created / captcha failed massages.
[DONE] -After inputting the captcha text in the dialog for a CryptoBullions initial registration, pressing <Enter> should press the dialog's OK button.
[DONE] -The CryptoBullions auto-payout threshold is defaulted to 0.01, for new users now. Logging-in is not needed anymore. Adjust the account creation sequence for this huge time savings for not having to solve captchas to login.
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v1.9.4.1

v13 Release (2017-08-04)
[DONE] -Fixing the portal homepage, to open either page full screen
[DONE] -Allow old username format of BTC address only, and must be on the FoldingCoin Team with a warning about not being able to earn CURE
[DONE] -Limit FAH username to 2 underscores. 3+ underscores are not parsed but the current distribution server (likely to be updated soon)
[DONE] -Block against special characters in FAH username, and especially block "@" for email addresses as a username, which looses everything after "@". See: http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/stats-teams-usernames/ -"If you choose your email address as your username, we will use the full email address but NOT print the full email address. Instead, just the part before the @ sign will be used in any stats listing, etc."
[DONE] -Show language selection box in the installer (Danish Windows selected the first alphabetical language, like Arabic. So, did the CureCoin wallet software, according to the user)
[DONE] -Make the CureCoin Folding Pool Login button like the others, to make it more accessible for people who use it more often

[DONE] -Upgraded the CefSharp Chrome Web Browser Component from: v55 to v57
v11 Release (2017-04-14)
[DONE] -Updated the FAH download link for the new WordPress-based website: https://folding.stanford.edu/start-folding/
v10 Release (2017-04-02)
[DONE] -Enable Multi-language support for installer (The license, (2) installation sections, and their descriptions are not translated)
[DONE] -Add secondary CounterWallet site (counterwallet.coindaddy.io) for when the main site (wallet.counterwallet.io) is down. counterwallet.io: They say it's the "same". "If having issues with one, feel free to try another. Your wallet will work on either."

v9 Release (2017-03-04)
[DONE] -Add note about how CureCoin's POS works, mostly for new users
[DONE] -Check for the Wallet.dat file existing to set the checkbox for the CureCoin folding pool setup? (would need to detect this in the installer before installing / launching it from the installer)
[DONE] -No Dat file error on initial install with previous install INI file only. HideSavedDataButton INI value not written.
[DONE] -Message to leave the CURE wallet open
[DONE] -Saved Data: 'Add New or Existing Info' checkbox: Renamed to: Show Raw Data, and inverted what it does

[DONE] -Browser: Launch FAH (restarting the PC is not required). Show control web page (in the FoldingBrowser, because it won't be the default browser)?

(Skip) -Strip out all not allowed characters that can be pasted in to the username textbox --> TextboxEx? -Automatic character removal with no warning that the pasted text was modified was originally (less desirable, but probably better. Make warning message).
(Skip) -A button to manually (unload the browser component), dump the cache, (and reload the browser)? Or, set a flag to do this on program exit.
(Skip) -Add 'bookmark' link button titles and links to a separate INI file, that can be replaced to update. (No, not secure)
(Skip) -Other CureCoin websites: https://curecoin.info     https://curecoin.io/      (Using:) http://curecoin.net/      (No, other websites are being consolidated into the one)
(Skip) -Mempool Transaction Count: https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-count?timespan=1week     Use: https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ and https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h to help determine sufficient miners fees to keep your TX from getting stuck in the mempool

(Skip) -The CefSharp black pop-up console window from the FoldingCoin website says "NOT SANDBOXED" for less than a second. Looking into this: it's marked as a 'Won't Fix' issue, so just keep ignoring it...
(Skip) -Make all the entries for each Wallet slot in the DAT, and just leave unused blank?
(Skip) -Login to CureCoin Pool: Display text for the Pool Pin once you've logged in (so you could copy and make changes later)? -Probably better as is, to lookup in saved data when needed.
