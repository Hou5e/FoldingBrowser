=====================
All-in-One Installer:
=====================


-----------------------------------
Immediate Need /  Short-Term Goals:
-----------------------------------

-Code signing improvement: Dual sign SHA1 & SHA256 for installers & executables
-Support other wallets?  like:  https://freewallet.io/     (Using:)https://counterwallet.io/    wallet.indiesquare.me    also: rarepepewallet.com would work
-Ability to select alternate from: http://foldingcoin.xyz/?token=FLDC&total=250000&start=2017-08-21&end=2017-08-22 to using: http://fldc-stats.tokenly.com/?token=FLDC&total=250000&start=2017-08-21&end=2017-08-22
-Use built-in multi-language uninstaller strings for uninstaller dialog on upgrading?
-Look into enabling Google Translate in Chrome/CefSharp for automatic web page translations
-Enable Multi-language support in the FoldingBrowser App to view pages that are available in other languages (Allow users to change the locale & supported languages)?
-Add Multi-language support in the FoldingBrowser App for buttons and tooltips?

-CTRL+F5: to dump the cache like Chrome? Or a button to manually (unload the browser component), dump the cache, (and reload the browser)?
-CTRL+F: Find text in a page functionality? (searching for BTC address on distribution page, etc)

-Improve the portal web page (eliminate some buttons in the browser?)
-Add FLDC & CURE Ticker info from Coin Market Cap API (or pull from exchanges?). Update hourly? Do as notify icon? Might not be worth it, if the FLDC homepage gets it. See:  https://coinmarketcap.com/api/    https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/CureCoin/
-Add option to get Wallet info from blockchain explorer APIs to display value? FLDC- https://xchain.io/     CURE-  https://chainz.cryptoid.info/cure
-Save some stats from API data, and show difference from last time, or from a past time interval?
-Add notify icon (system tray icon) for folding with NaCl Chrome Plug-in (add option to enable / disable exiting on program close) and other coin ticker info

----------------------------------------------------
Other Ideas, Improvements, Tasks, Longer-Term Goals:
----------------------------------------------------

-Split the installation video into initial install and features to keep it shorter.
-Add images to improve other dialog prompts (It will help non-English speaking users)
-Simplicity: Ideally, you only want to enter username and email, and you are up and Folding (as other users have described).
-Simple version of the FoldingBrowser: mostly to only run the FAH NaCl Chrome Plugin client
-Plugin: Add an Ad Blocker?
-Cross-compile for Linux and Mac version ideas:
  -Try '.NET Core' simple project for Linux and Mac? (probably not if CefSharp isn't compatible)
  -Create a separate Electron framework App for Mac and Linux of the simple version that only runs the FAH NaCl Chrome Plugin client? -Try the FLDC Bar Electron app as a possible starting point?
  -Can the FoldingBrowser run on Wine in Linux? And, then update the FoldingBrowser to use the appropriate files and paths for Linux?
-Option to monitor FAH clients and restart them if they hang?

-Option to create backup copies of the settings in a 'Backup' folder periodically, or get a pop-up reminder on a time interval?
-Change the Default password: INI file: when encryption PW is blank, prompt for PW, if encryption fails (for extra security for not keeping the PW in a text file in your user account). Option to be prompted for it: once per session, or prompted every time when needed.
-Make a better way to determine if the DAT file loads. This won't work: DAT.ToString.Length = 0, it really needs to be .SaveToString(), but all you want to know is there data loaded or not. You don't need a full text string output...
-Restore from backup button (or separate app)? Make something to make setting up multiple computers easier (rename existing files, and copy new one) (and telnet FAH settings from Config file)
-Add stop button to cancel the automated process?
-Get Wallet with CounterPart API instead of current methods from web page clicks? (probably more work than it's worth)
-Support other block explorers?  like: (Using:)https://xchain.io/     (depreciated) https://counterpartychain.io/      https://chain.so/      https://walletapp.indiesquare.me/explorer/      https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/<addy>      https://xcpdex.com/
-Change to the new FLDC username format (Nope, not yet, as of Nov 2017)

-Improve the CureCoin HTTP JSON-RPC to use the JSON parser, and find the wallet if there is more than one entry or (blank and a name)
-Show image of where to get the CURE wallet address, for message when it can't be found
-Make the other webpage wait loops use Javascript for detecting stuff is there (like the CureCoin webpage login)

Change Log - Release Notes - Tasks completed:
======================================================================================================

v15 Release (12/0?/2017)
[DONE] -Adding attempts to pressing the EOC button to get the UserId from searching for their FAH Username (the 3 attempts is for new users who's username won't be searchable for the first ~24 hours: Hopefully this will let them retry some other day)
[DONE] -Setup code signing certificate to sign installer & FoldingBrowser executable
[DONE] -Replace Slack with Discord for both CureCoin and FoldingCoin button links
[Known Issue] -Discord invites go to a blank page (Press the 'Discord' button again to reload/fix), and fail to load with error: WebSocket connection to 'ws://127.0.0.1:6465/?v=1' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (https://discordapp.com/assets/7bb110c91ee0ded4782a.js, ln 17 )
[DONE] -Option to change the initial portal homepage. Choices: Default (Both FoldingCoin and CureCoin), FoldingCoin, CureCoin, EOC, Folding@Home Web Control, Blank
[DONE] -Fix to disable the OK button until the FAH settings are saved. Pausing FAH with Telnet was not awaited, and was undoing this on an initial install only
[DONE] -Improvement to hide the Cancel button, in favor of showing: Attempt 1 of 3, for the Captcha text input at CryptoBullions
[DONE] -Add instructions for compiling the NSIS installation kit
[DONE] -Trim the input Email text for getting a passkey
v14 Release (10/31/2017)
[DONE] -Pause folding on initial install: set FAH option for pause=true(didn't work in FAH v7.4.16), idle=true (used), or power=light (CPU folds and GPU on idle) to avoid the system being sluggish during install
[DONE] -Add additional detection for the CounterWallet server being down for syncing to the blockchain, for using the alternate server
[DONE] -Make the portal homepage internal within the app
[DONE] -In the FAH Username selection, allow the CureCoin username format for earning CureCoin only (no FLDC username rules, just warnings). This is now allowed but not obvious on purpose.
[DONE] -Improve the CureCoin pool sign up process, search for: account created / captcha failed massages.
[DONE] -After inputting the captcha text in the dialog for a CryptoBullions initial registration, pressing <Enter> should press the dialog's OK button.
[DONE] -The CryptoBullions auto-payout threshold is defaulted to 0.01, for new users now. Logging-in is not needed anymore. Adjust the account creation sequence for this huge time savings for not having to solve captchas to login.
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v1.9.4.1
[DONE] -Set the CureCoin wallet address on the new Registration page. It will be required for new users signing up soon.
[DONE] -Fix the URL bar alignment to the text & buttons (it got shifted to the right in v13)

[DONE] -Fixing the portal homepage, to open either page full screen
[DONE] -Allow old username format of BTC address only, and must be on the FoldingCoin Team with a warning about not being able to earn CURE
[DONE] -Limit FAH username to 2 underscores. 3+ underscores are not parsed but the current distribution server (likely to be updated soon)
[DONE] -Block against special characters in FAH username, and especially block "@" for email addresses as a username, which looses everything after "@". See: http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/stats-teams-usernames/ -"If you choose your email address as your username, we will use the full email address but NOT print the full email address. Instead, just the part before the @ sign will be used in any stats listing, etc."
[DONE] -Show language selection box in the installer (Danish Windows selected the first alphabetical language, like Arabic. So, did the CureCoin wallet software, according to the user)
[DONE] -Make the CureCoin Folding Pool Login button like the others, to make it more accessible for people who use it more often
[DONE] -Remove the FLDC 'Stats' button (FLDC.tech is discontinued for now)
v12 Release (6/9/2017)
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v1.9.2.1
[DONE] -Update link to new CounterParty block explorer: https://xchain.io/
[DONE] -"Portal" FLDC & CURE web page for the browser homepage (iframe both CURE and FLDC webpages side by side)
[DONE] -Make the FoldingBrowser more neutral for CURE & FLDC (Like the desktop / program icon was still FLDC, the homepage was FLDC only)
